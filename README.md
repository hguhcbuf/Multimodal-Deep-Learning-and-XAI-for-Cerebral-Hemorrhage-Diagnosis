# Multimodal-Deep-Learning-and-XAI-for-Cerebral-Hemorrhage-Diagnosis

team 3



Images are the largest source of data in healthcare and, at the same time, one of the most difficult sources to analyze. 

Our goal is to use multimodal medical imaging to provide a separate yet complementary structure and function information of a patient study 

The motivation for multimodal imaging is to obtain a superior and exquisite image that will provide more reliable statistics than single images


##Data

Our diagnostic tools include Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 81 different patients.

The data are labeled into 5 different categories, which are the types of cerebral hemorrhage
